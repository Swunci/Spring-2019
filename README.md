# Spring-2019-SBML

This project was created over the time span of 3 homework assignemnts for course about the principles of programming languages.
SBML is a programming language implemented using Python Lex & Yacc and it is similar to Smlnj with a few differences. I used nodes to
implement the required expressions, statements, and functions.
